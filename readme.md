## Before you start

Please, before you start, install all the requirements using pip `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Python3 is required.

Also change the template location in file _analysis\_run.py

After you did all that, please refer to _example.yaml_ as YAML-configuration example.

Pipeline is run using `python run.py example.yaml`

Best of Luck
